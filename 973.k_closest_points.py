"""
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the
X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance
(i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique
(except for the order that it is in).

I knew the solution but it took a little fiddling.  Counterintuitively,
since we want to find the k smallest quantities, we need to maintain a *max*
heap, replacing the max every time a smaller item is found.
