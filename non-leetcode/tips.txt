Tips

1.  If the problem is API / transactional, some internal state must be maintained
between API calls, either written to or read from.  This state should be the minimal
possible information needed to service *all* API calls.

2.  Read the entire problem and have a spec worked out *before* coding anything.

3.  If the state involves hierarchy, write out the schema for the state and
experiment until you like it.

4.  Look at the scale of the problem factors (i.e. n <= 5000)  If they are small-ish,
there is no need to over-optimize.

5.  I expect the algorithm will be obvious and not require fancy tricks.
