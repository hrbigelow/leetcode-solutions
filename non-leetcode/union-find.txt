Union-find is a lightweight way to count the number of connected components in a very
specific kind of graph.

The graph is a forest in which each node has an out-degree of 1, with the semantics
that the edge points to the node's parent.  By convention, a node pointing to itself
is considered the 'root' of a tree.

At start, every node is a root.  As the algorithm progresses, groups of nodes form a
single tree.  The operation of joining two nodes first finds each of their respective
roots of the trees they belong, and then grafts one of those roots onto the other,
joining them in a single tree.

At the end, one wants to find the roots of each node to label them as belonging to a
particular tree.
